\usage{
split_text(text, by = "paragraph")

\description{
This function splits text into smaller elements based on the specified granularity: paragraphs, sentences, or words.

Splitting by 'sentence' may not be perfect for complex text structures with abbreviations, numbers, etc.
For more robust sentence tokenization, consider using a natural language processing library.
